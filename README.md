## Guide  

This guide was made 8 months after the work had been done. If I ever modify another, I will update this guide to be more specific and show the steps more accurately.  

1. Remove 2 screws around the charging port.  ![Remove Screws](/img/1.png)  
1. Use plastic pry tool to remove top cover.  ![Remove Top Cover](/img/2.png)  
     - Be careful on the top right clip, a ribbon cable is behind the clip.  
     - The cover is held in with double sided tape, so a bit of force is needed to pull it off.  
1. Inside view.  ![Inside View](/img/3.png)  
1. Remove 4 screws from top cover.  ![Remove Screws](/img/4.png)

1. Soldor wire to outlined area.  ![Solder Wire](/img/6.png)  
     - If you mess up and remove the pad from the board, a backup location can be used.  ![Backup Location](/img/7.png)  This location is not recommended.  I had to cut the button pad where the wire runs to make it fit.  ![Cut Pad](/img/8.png)  I suggest not fucking up.

1. Cut the Star wires to remove the speaker.  <br/>Cut the Square wires to remove the vibrator.  ![Cut Wires](/img/13.png)  The square wire is where we need to solder our own wire for the switch.  
1. I used a box cutter and sand paper to cut the switch down so that it would fit into the hole left by the speaker.  ![Cut Switch](/img/15.png)  ![Cut Switch](/img/16.png)
1. Solder our wire from the top board to the outside leg of our switch, and the bottom board to the middle leg of the switch.  ![Solder Wire](/img/14.png)
